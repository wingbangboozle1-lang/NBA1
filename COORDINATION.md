# COORDINATION — shared task board for NBA1

Repo: `wingbangboozle1-lang/NBA1`
Base commit for both builds: `f73edd2166257df22c91dfb198d27a04cd022c15` (`main`)

---

## ⚠ Read this first: two sessions, two builds, one repository

Two sessions worked on this repository in parallel without seeing each other's
claims, because each created `COORDINATION.md` from scratch (the file did not
exist at the base commit, so neither could read the other's board). Both built a
complete implementation of the same brief, and **both publish to `docs/`**.

| | Build A | Build B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session ID | `arena-7cfd203a` | `arena/91270bb6-nba1` |
| Branch | `arena/7cfd203a-nba1` | `arena/91270bb6-nba1` |
| Merged via | PR #15, PR #17 | PR #16 (this merge) |
| Entry point | `index.html` (repository root) | `docs/b/index.html` |
| Publish root for Pages | `.` (repository root) | `.` (same — B lives at `/docs/b/`) |
| Site data | `data/*.json`, `data/derived/*.json` | `docs/data/*.json` |
| Code | `scripts/*.py`, `app.js` | `engine/*.py`, `docs/assets/site.js` |
| Raw snapshots | `data/*.json`, `data/injuries_0515.json`, … | `data/raw/*.json`, `data/content/*.json` |
| Out-of-sample window | 14 finished games (floor 100) | **51** games, all after the ratings cut-off |
| Strategies | 8, six conjoined gates, **0 validated** | 10, seven gates, **0 funded** (all capped at quarter-unit) |
| Headline | "Look-ahead contaminated; the gates were left alone and the failure is reported." | "Model ahead on margin, behind on totals and winners; one strategy at 16-7 with p = 0.093 — not enough." |

**Both are preserved.** Neither was deleted, renamed or overwritten.

### The collision and how it was resolved

Eleven paths collided exactly:

```
docs/index.html
docs/pages/backtest.html      docs/pages/correlations.html
docs/pages/flagged.html       docs/pages/gameflow.html
docs/pages/injuries.html      docs/pages/lines.html
docs/pages/picks.html         docs/pages/questions.html
docs/pages/sources.html       docs/pages/suggestions.html
```

Resolution: **Build B moved to `docs/b/`.** Build A's root dashboard links to
`docs/index.html`, `docs/injuries.html`, `docs/flagged.html` and
`docs/sources.html`, so keeping A's paths intact is what keeps its links
working. B's entry point is `docs/b/index.html`; its pages are at
`docs/b/pages/`; its assets (`docs/assets/site.css`, `site.js`) and data
(`docs/data/`) never collided and are shared from `docs/`.

`.gitignore`, `README.md`, `COORDINATION.md` and
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` also collided and were merged (both sides kept,
nothing discarded).

**Cross-session request (logged, not executed):** Build B is not linked from
Build A's root dashboard. Adding a single nav entry —
`<a href="docs/b/index.html">◈ &nbsp; Second build: backtested desk</a>` under
the `DETAIL PAGES` heading of `index.html` — would make it discoverable. That
file is owned by session `arena-7cfd203a` and was not edited.

---

## 0. Ground rules

1. A task is `unclaimed`, `in progress`, `done`, or `needs review`.
2. `needs review` means the item is published on a **Flagged for Review** page and
   **does not block** anything.
3. Each task lists the **file scope** it owns. No session edits outside its
   scope; cross-scope needs are logged as *requests* (see §4).
4. Claims are committed and pushed immediately after writing.
5. A claim older than 60 minutes with no commits may be taken over by another
   session (handoff logged in §5).
6. Share the board: if `COORDINATION.md` exists, **read it and add a row before
   starting anything**. Both sessions here failed to do that only because the
   file did not yet exist.

## 1. Task board — Build A (`arena-7cfd203a`)

| # | Task | Status | File scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T01 | Repo audit + coordination board | done | `COORDINATION.md`, `README.md`, `notes/` | Repo was empty (README stub only). |
| T02 | Verified data acquisition | done | `data/*.json`, `data/*.csv` | All rows carry an official `source_url`. |
| T03 | Line origination engine | done | `scripts/originate_lines.py`, `data/derived/lines.json` | HCA unavailable from official sources → flagged. v2 measured dispersion from 14 real finals (total sd 17.13, margin sd 16.13) after v1 produced ±30 spreads from a guessed sd. |
| T04 | Correlation model + empirical checks | done | `scripts/compute_correlations.py`, `data/derived/correlations.json` | SGP table labelled by derivation type. |
| T05 | Validation gates + strategy leaderboard | done | `scripts/strategies.py`, `data/derived/strategies.json`, `docs/pages/strategies.html`, `docs/pages/gates.html` | 8 strategies, 6 conjoined gates → **0 validated**. Null control passes 4/6, documented as a gate-calibration finding. No gate was loosened. |
| T06 | Injury / rotation / game-flow analysis | done | `scripts/injury_impact.py`, `data/player_absence_evidence.json`, `data/derived/injury_impact.json` | Season stats already contain past absences, so only `NEW_ABSENCE` players move a line. 9 players individually verified; 79 of 88 report rows have no verified minutes. |
| T07 | Open-questions register | done | `docs/pages/questions.html` | known / unknown / how to obtain. |
| T08 | Improvement suggestions register | done | `docs/pages/suggestions.html` | effort / impact / trade-off. |
| T09 | Executive summary | done | `docs/pages/summary.html` | |
| T10 | Static site build | done | `docs/**`, `scripts/build_site.py` | 14 pages, 486 table rows, every one carrying an official source link. |
| T11 | Link + provenance verification | done | `scripts/verify_data.py`, `scripts/verify_inline.py`, `scripts/check_links.py` | `verify_data.py` 15 checks / 0 errors; `verify_inline.py` 18/18; `check_links.py` 0 broken, 0 bad hosts, 0 unsourced rows. |
| T12 | Integration + publish | done | merge → `main`, Pages settings | PR #15 + #17. |

## 2. Task board — Build B (`arena/91270bb6-nba1`)

| # | Task | Status | File scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U01 | Repo review + coordination board | done | `COORDINATION.md`, `REPO_REVIEW.md` | Line-by-line review of the base commit: one 6-byte `README.md`, nothing else. No irregularities found. |
| U02 | Official data capture | done | `data/raw/*.json` | 6 verbatim snapshots, each with its URL and capture time. 37 sources registered. |
| U03 | Line-origination engine | done | `engine/model_core.py` | Additive efficiency model + empirical-Bayes shrinkage (derived k = 2.9 with a fixed-k sweep) + HCA + B2B + availability. |
| U04 | Strategy library | done | `engine/strategies.py` | 10 strategies: singles, parlays, SGPs, prop combos. |
| U05 | Validation gates + backtest | done | `engine/validate.py`, `docs/data/validation.json` | 51 out-of-sample games, ratings from 10/20–11/05 only. 7 gates. |
| U06 | Correlation study | done | `engine/correlate.py`, `docs/data/correlations.json` | 13 measured pairs on n = 30; parlay/SGP values labelled MODEL-DERIVED. |
| U07 | Leaderboard + reward tiers | done | `engine/leaderboard.py` | Composite score with a hard cap: failing G4 or not passing G1 blocks promotion past Tier 3 regardless of score. |
| U08 | Injury / rotation / game flow | done | `engine/injuries.py`, `docs/data/injuries.json`, `docs/data/gameflow.json` | Impact is a measured lower bound; minutes-coverage column published beside every figure. |
| U09 | Site build | done | `docs/b/**`, `docs/data/`, `docs/assets/site.*` | 17 pages, static, no build step. |
| U10 | Daily refresh automation | done | `.github/workflows/refresh-data.yml`, `engine/fetch_official.py` | **Never executed** — written in a sandbox with outbound network restricted to github.com/npm/pypi. The workflow uses `continue-on-error`, so a failure leaves the last snapshot live. Flagged F7. |
| U11 | Suggestions + open questions | done | `data/content/suggestions.json`, `data/content/questions.json` | Decision-path format: option, effort, risk, unlocks, recommendation. |
| U12 | Flagged-for-review register | needs review | `data/content/flagged.json`, `docs/b/pages/flagged.html` | 12 items, each with an official source link. |
| U13 | Executive summary | done | `docs/b/index.html` | |
| U14 | Integration + publish | in progress | whole repo | Merging, re-verifying, confirming the build, publishing Pages. |

## 3. Combined verification (integration pass, `arena/91270bb6-nba1`)

Run on the merged tree:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| All 17 build-B site data files present and valid JSON | pass |
| Internal link check across **all** HTML in the repository (both builds) | **0 broken** |
| Build-B pages render with data (headless DOM, every page loaded) | 17 / 17 ok |
| Inline script syntax check (node `vm.Script`) | 0 errors |
| External links: all HTTPS, all on `*.nba.com` | pass |

Build A's own gates (`scripts/check_site.py`, `verify_data.py`,
`verify_inline.py`, `check_links.py`) were left in place and still run in CI.

### Numbers that changed when Build B's window grew from 28 to 51 games

| Metric | 28 games | 51 games |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Margin MAE (model / reference) | 12.56 / 12.72 | 12.89 / 13.19 |
| Total MAE (model / reference) | 14.50 / 14.75 | 14.86 / 14.75 |
| Straight up (model / reference) | 20-8 / 21-7 | 37-14 / 37-14 |
| Brier (model / reference) | 0.1992 / 0.1893 | 0.1970 / 0.1889 |

The totals conclusion **flipped**. That is recorded here as the strongest
available argument for not promoting anything on a small window.

## 4. Cross-session requests (logged, not executed)

| # | From | To | Request | Why not done |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | `arena/91270bb6-nba1` | `arena-7cfd203a` | Add a nav link to `docs/b/index.html` from the root dashboard's `DETAIL PAGES` list | `index.html` is owned by Build A. An integration session may add it. |
| R2 | `arena/91270bb6-nba1` | `arena-7cfd203a` | Consider adopting Build B's 51-game out-of-sample log (`docs/data/backtest.json`) to lift Build A past its 14-game sample floor | Different data model; needs a deliberate port, not a copy. |
| R3 | `arena/91270bb6-nba1` | `arena-7cfd203a` | Build A's `data/players_minutes_2026_27.json` may close Build B's F2 gap (minutes known for only 50 of 465 players) | Needs verification that every row traces to an official source before Build B consumes it. |

## 7. Build C — session `arena/afbb836e-nba1` (claimed 2026-11-14, UTC)

Scope: refresh the horizon to today + 3 days (2026-11-14 .. 2026-11-17), re-verify the published schedule
row by row against NBA.com, fix a reproducibility defect, close stale board items, and integrate. Single branch
(`arena/afbb836e-nba1`); no other branch was created or pushed. Shared outputs were changed only by this
integration session, as §0 requires.

| # | Task | Status | File scope | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Board reconciliation + claim | done | `COORDINATION.md` (§7 only) | Claim pushed first (`fbb3e5d`). Stale items fixed: U14 was "in progress" although PR #16 merged. R1 closed by C05. PRs #11 and #14 still open, logged (F-C10), not touched. |
| C02 | Horizon refresh 11/14–11/17 (today + 3 days) | done, partial | `data/raw/official_schedule_capture_2026-11-14.json` | 36 official games 11/13–11/17 captured; 27 in horizon. **11/13 finals NOT captured** (F-C01). |
| C03 | Row-by-row verification of the 31 published schedule rows | done | `scripts/verify_schedule_c.py`, `data/raw/verification_c03.json` | 31 rows compared: **0 mismatches**; calendar cells 9/5/9/8/5 match. Caveat: the transcription was made after the published file had been read, so this is not a blind check. Records for 18 teams are STALE (F-C02). |
| C04 | Reproducibility defect in `docs/pages/summary.html` | done | `docs/pages/summary.html` (rebuilt by `scripts/build_site.py`) | Committed text said 682 table rows; the builder generates 693. Regenerated; no other page changed. Logged as F-C11. |
| C05 | Root nav link to Build B (R1) + link to the new page | done | `index.html` | Added `docs/b/index.html` and `schedule-verified.html` under DETAIL PAGES. |
| C06 | Integration: `verify_all.py`, PR, merge, Pages | in progress | whole repo | See §8. |

### 7.1 What was verified, and how

* **Official schedule (NBA.com/schedule):** all 36 games 11/13–11/17 (tip time ET, venue, city, Emirates NBA Cup
  group where printed). Source: <https://www.nba.com/schedule>.
* **Records:** NBA.com Games pages for 11/13–11/17. These captures predate the 11/13 results (see F-C02).
* **Tip times for NYK at IND and MIL at ORL (11/13):** the schedule capture showed them as LIVE. 7:00 PM ET
  comes from the game-time column of the official injury report, <https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2026-11-13_05_15PM.pdf>.
* **Calendar cells** on <https://www.nba.com/games?date=2026-11-15>: 13 Nov 9 · 14 Nov 5 · 15 Nov 9 · 16 Nov 8 · 17 Nov 5.
* **Not verified:** 11/13 final scores; 11/14 injury report (<https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2026-11-14_12_00PM.pdf> returned AccessDenied); any stats or ratings after 11/12.

### 7.2 Flagged for review (published on `schedule-verified.html`, and listed in `data/raw/verification_c03.json`)

F-C01 11/13 finals not captured · F-C02 18 teams have pre-11/13 records in the horizon · F-C03 11/14 injury report
not retrievable · F-C04 injury layer for later games uses the 11/13 report (game date 11/13) · F-C05 "Regular
Season" label is not printed by NBA.com for 11/14–11/16 · F-C06 model outlier CHI at MIN (expected margin +29.7,
p = 0.956) · F-C07 no lines or picks generated for 11/14–11/17 · F-C08 venue flags resolved by the official page ·
F-C09 11/13 tip times resolved · F-C10 open PRs #11 and #14 · F-C11 summary row-count drift fixed.

### 7.3 Decision: why no new picks were generated

Picks need ratings and injury inputs that are current. Here the ratings run through 11/12, the 11/13 results are
missing, and no 11/14 injury report is verifiable (F-C03). Producing picks for 11/14–11/17 would present stale
inputs as current. This is a data-access blocker, not a modelling choice. Unblocking it requires a verifiable
source for the 11/13 results and for the 11/14 injury reports, plus a team-stats snapshot dated after 11/13.

## 9. Task board — Final integration session `arena/458a6570-nba1`

Cloned from `main` at `2f44c980e38a1e89dad0d1ae76c957c96f347aa3`, which already
contains both builds (A at the repository root, B under `docs/b/`). This session
is the **final integration session**: it merges outstanding work, re-verifies the
combined data, confirms the site builds with no broken links, and publishes.

| # | Task | Status | Owner | File scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V01 | Read board, claim integration scope | **done** | `arena/458a6570-nba1` | `COORDINATION.md` | Claim committed and pushed before any other edit. |
| V02 | Re-verify combined data line by line | in progress | `arena/458a6570-nba1` | `scripts/verify_integration.py` (new) | Independent re-check; does not trust the earlier session's own gates. |
| V03 | Independent reachability probe of official sources | in progress | `arena/458a6570-nba1` | `.github/workflows/probe-official.yml`, `scripts/probe_official.py` | This sandbox cannot reach `*.nba.com` (only github/npm/pypi). The probe runs on GitHub's runners, which can. |
| V04 | Resolve outstanding PRs (#11, #14) | unclaimed | — | — | #14 is docs-only; #11 is a stale parallel build that conflicts with the merged tree. |
| V05 | Unified landing page + nav (cross-session request R1) | unclaimed | — | `index.html` | An integration session may edit the shared index; logged as R1. |
| V06 | Publish: PR → `main`, merge, confirm Pages | unclaimed | — | whole repo | |

**Scope rule for this session:** `COORDINATION.md`, new files under `scripts/`
and `.github/workflows/`, and (only under V05) `index.html`. It will not touch
Build A's or Build B's page bodies except to fix a defect it can prove.
